      <description>I made a portfolio website using only HTML without any styles. The intention was to push the limits of pure HTML and see its capabilities, and it was worth it. These are some of the things I’ve learned during the process.
1.&amp;lt;body&amp;gt; tag has some styling properties The body tag has some styling properties, but most of them are depreciated. There are attributes to change background color, text color, background image, hyperlink colors, and margin.</description>

      <title>Why You Should Use Error Boundaries in React</title>

      <description>React Error Boundaries were introduced in React version 16 to generate a fallback UI in case a component were to crash. This was to ensure that a JavaScript error in a single component should not crash the whole app.
Consider the following React application which renders the component DisplayName displaying the name according to the input data.
import DisplayName from &amp;#34;./DisplayName&amp;#34;; function App() { return ( &amp;lt;div className=&amp;#34;App&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;DisplayName name={{ firstName: &amp;#34;John&amp;#34;, secondName: &amp;#34;Doe&amp;#34; }} /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;DisplayName name={{ firstName: &amp;#34;Lex&amp;#34;, secondName: &amp;#34;Luthor&amp;#34; }} /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;DisplayName name={{ firstName: &amp;#34;Peter&amp;#34;, secondName: &amp;#34;Parker&amp;#34; }} /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; ); } export default App; The DisplayName component simply displays the name from the passed down name object.</description>

      <description>This is a continuation to my earlier article : 4 JavaScript tips for shorter code
 1. Replace Switch or If-Else with key value pairs The switch statement and if-else statement evaluates an expression and executes statements associated with that case. But as the number of cases increases the code grows as well.
function returnDaySwitch(val) { switch (val) { case 1: return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s monday&amp;#34;; case 2: return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s tuesday&amp;#34;; case 3: return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s wednesday&amp;#34;; case 4: return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s thursday&amp;#34;; case 5: return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s friday&amp;#34;; case 6: return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s saturday&amp;#34;; case 7: return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s sunday&amp;#34;; default: return &amp;#34;Enter a value between 1 - 7&amp;#34;; } } function returnDayIfElse(val) { if(val==1){ return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s monday&amp;#34;; }else if(val==2){ return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s tuesday&amp;#34;; }else if(val==3){ return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s wednesday&amp;#34;; }else if(val==4){ return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s thursday&amp;#34;; }else if(val==5){ return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s friday&amp;#34;; }else if(val==6){ return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s saturday&amp;#34;; }else if(val==7){ return &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s sunday&amp;#34;; }else{ return &amp;#34;Enter a value between 1 - 7&amp;#34;; } } const day = 3; console.</description>

      <description>React.js is currently the most popular front-end JavaScript library for building Web applications. It is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. It renders the UI as per user requirements and plays nicely with any stack. In this article, we shall go through how React rethinks some of the best practices in web development.

      <description>Is React a Framework ? As per the landing page of React , it is a JavaScript library to build user interfaces. Its not a framework, but a library. Angular, Vue, Next.js, Gatsby, Redwood.js etc are examples for frameworks. A framework includes resources that a large-scale application might need : creating forms, running automated tests, making network requests etc. Whereas React itself does not include many of these functionalities. Core react is used only to build User Interfaces.</description>

      <description>There are plenty of tips which can be followed to make the JavaScript code shorter as well less complicated. I will share four of such tips which have reduced the effort and development time for me a lot while coding.
1. Short Circuiting This can be used when you’ll have to use a simple if condition.
if( x == 0 ){ foo() } Short circuiting can be achieved by using &amp;amp;&amp;amp; operator.</description>

      <title>Using Clamp() for Responsiveness</title>
      <link>https://blog.abhinavvp.com/posts/using-clamp-for-responsiveness/</link>

      <description>Clamp() is one of the most useful yet underrated functions in CSS to ensure responsiveness in web design. Web pages can be viewed from multiple platforms, and you will have to ensure that the design won&amp;rsquo;t break in any of the viewports.
 Consider an id &amp;lsquo;text&amp;rsquo; with font-size as 3rem.
#text{ font-size:3rem; } The problem is that irrespective of the viewport, font size remains constant. One way to deal with this is to replace rem with % or vw so that the font size becomes relative to the viewport.</description>
